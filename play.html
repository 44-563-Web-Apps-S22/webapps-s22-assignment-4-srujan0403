    <h3>The Miser</h3>

    <h4>SCENE I.--CLÉANTE, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE.</h4>
    <pre>
            CLE. Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one
            about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly.

            ELI. Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I
            know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I
            assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you.

            MAR. I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a
            person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a
            friendship so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate.

            FRO. You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all
            this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have
            carried things so far.

            CLE. What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.
            But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do? What resolution
            have you taken?

            MAR. Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as
            I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?

            CLE. No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?
            No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection?

            MAR. What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what
            I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely
            to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what
            is modest and seemly.

            CLE. Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided
            entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety.

            MAR. But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest
            myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too
            much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great
            tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can
            with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you
            wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my
            feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it
            myself if necessary.
