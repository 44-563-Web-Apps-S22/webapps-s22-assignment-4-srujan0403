    <h3>The Miser</h3>

    <h4>SCENE I.--CLÉANTE, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE.</h4>
    

           <h6 class="CLE">CLE . </h6> 
           <p class="speech">
            Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one<br>
            about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly.</p>

           <h6 class="ELI">ELI.</h6>
           <p class="speech"> 
            Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I
            know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I
            assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you.</p>

            <h6 class="MAR">MAR.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a<br>
            person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a<br>
            friendship so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate.</p>

            
            <h6 class="FRO">FRO.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all<br>
            this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have<br>
            carried things so far.</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do? What resolution<br>
            have you taken?</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            MAR. Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as<br>
            I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            CLE. No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?<br>
            No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection?</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            MAR. What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what<br>
            I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely<br>
            to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what<br>
            is modest and seemly.</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            CLE. Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided<br>
            entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety.</p>

            <h6 class="CLE">CLE.</h6>
            <p class="speech"> 
            What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.<br>
            MAR. But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest<br>
            myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too<br>
            much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great<br>
            tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can<br>
            with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you<br>
            wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my<br>
            feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it<br>
            myself if necessary.</p>
